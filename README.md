Assembly Line Machines
This is Assembly Line Machines, a complete reemagining of Minecraft's technological side. This mod features new features and an entirely new progression system, built from the ground up to give much more depth to Minecraft.

Features
This mod adds over 200 new items and blocks into Minecraft, with progression built to last over six hours of standard gameplay. We are always growing features with regular updates planned, so please stay tuned and submit your requests for features at our GitHub repository, featured below.

Downloads
This version of the mod is only for 1.16.5, used with the Forge Mod Loader, and can be downloaded from CurseForge. 1.16.5 will only be receiving backport patches for critical bugs discovered, and all new features are released for 1.17 and later moving forward. Please note that these two locations are the only two officially available versions of this mod at this time, and thus any redistribution websites shall not be considered official, and therefore will not receive support.
