# Assembly Line Machines

This is Assembly Line Machines, a complete reemagining of Minecraft's technological side.
This mod features new features and an entirely new progression system, built from the ground up to give much more depth
to Minecraft.

## Downloads

This mod is currently available for Minecraft 1.17.1, used with the Forge Mod Loader, and can be downloaded from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/assemblylinemachines). Please note that these two locations are the only two officially available versions of this mod at this time, and thus any redistribution websites shall not be considered official, and therefore will not receive support.

## Wiki

For documentation about progression, we strongly recommend [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli). That allows for in-game documentation to be presented in an aesthetically pleasing way. 

For developer/packmaker information, this site will host up-to-date documentation for that audience for people who may want to implement one of ALM's tags or recipe types themselves.

??? warning "Web Guide"
    There is also an out-of-date Web Guide available here, which covers content up until the mid-game. Please note that this information is relevant up until 1.17.1-1.2.1, and as the mod is updated, this information may lose accuracy.
