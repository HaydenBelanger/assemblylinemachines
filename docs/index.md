# Assembly Line Machines

This is Assembly Line Machines, a complete reimagining of Minecraft's technological side.
This mod features new features and an entirely new progression system, built from the ground up to give much more depth
to Minecraft.

## Downloads

This mod is currently available using the Forge Modloader for current versions of Minecraft, and can be downloaded from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/assemblylinemachines). Please note that the CurseForge is the only officially available download for this mod, and thus any redistribution websites shall not be considered official, and therefore will not receive support.

## Wiki

For documentation about progression, we strongly recommend [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli). That allows for in-game documentation to be presented in an aesthetically pleasing way. 

For developer/packmaker information, this site will host up-to-date documentation for that audience for people who may want to implement one of ALM's tags or recipe types themselves.

??? warning "Web Guide"
    There is also an out-of-date Web Guide available here, which covers content up until the mid-game. Please note that this information is relevant up until 1.17.1-1.2.1, and as the mod is updated, this information may lose accuracy.
